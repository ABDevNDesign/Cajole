# Streaming Widget for Fundraising Campaigns

Welcome to the **Streaming Widget** project by **AB Dev N Design**. This widget is designed to integrate with streaming software such as OBS, Streamlabs, and—if possible—Wirecast, Lightstream, and vMix. It displays real-time fundraising campaign data including a goal progress bar, stretch goals, backing alerts with our mascot Nigel’s face, a countdown clock for the final 24 hours, an optional QR code, and a live leaderboard.

## Features

- **Fundraising Goal Bar:** Automatically displays campaign progress by connecting to a campaign URL.
- **Stretch Goal Bars:** Up to three stretch goals are shown sequentially as each is met.
- **Countdown Clock:** Activates during the last 24 hours of the campaign.
- **Backing Alerts:** Live alerts with backing amount and username, using brand colors (green: `#28bf2c` for the latest and yellow: `#FDDE06` for previous alerts).
- **QR Code:** Option to display a QR code featuring Cajole’s mascot Nigel.
- **Leaderboard:** Live updating leaderboard replicating the campaign page’s standings.
