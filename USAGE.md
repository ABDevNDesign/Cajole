# Usage Instructions

This guide explains how to configure and use the Streaming Widget during your live stream.

## Initial Configuration

1. **Enter Campaign URL:**
   - When setting up the widget, input the URL of the fundraising campaign.
   - The widget will automatically connect and display the **Fundraising Goal Bar**.

2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - As donations come in, the **Goal Bar** and **Stretch Goals** will update in real time.
   - If a campaign reaches its main goal, the first **Stretch Goal Bar** will appear. Subsequent stretch goals will replace the previous one once reached.

## During the Stream

1. **Monitoring Backing Alerts:**
   - **Latest Alert:** Displayed in a green bubble (`#28bf2c`) with Nigel’s face and donation details.
   - **Previous Alerts:** Displayed in yellow bubbles (`#FDDE06`) and will cycle down with each new donation.

2. **Countdown Clock Activation:**
   - The countdown clock appears during the final 24 hours of the campaign.
   - It is positioned below the active goal bar.

3. **Optional QR Code:**
   - If you choose to display the QR code, ensure it is integrated into your layout.
   - The QR code includes a custom design featuring Nigel’s face.

4. **Using the Leaderboard:**
   - The optional **Leaderboard** widget mirrors the campaign page’s leaderboard.
   - This can be used to showcase top contributors and maintain engagement.

## Troubleshooting

- **Widget Not Updating:**  
  Check your internet connection and verify that the campaign URL is correct.

- **Display Issues:**  
  Adjust the browser source dimensions in your streaming software settings. Clear browser cache if necessary.
