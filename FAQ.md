## Q1: How do I connect the widget to my fundraising campaign?

**A:** Simply enter the campaign URL into the widget configuration. The widget fetches live data from the campaign page.

## Q2: What streaming platforms are supported?

**A:** The widget is designed primarily for OBS Studio and Streamlabs. We are working on compatibility with Wirecast, Lightstream, and vMix.

## Q3: How are backing alerts displayed?
